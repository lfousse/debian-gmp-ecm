	gmp -> GMP
	fixed one memory leak
	added missing (L)GPL headers

2005-02-22  paul  <zimmerma>

	* Makefile.am, README: forgot to install ecm.h

	* AUTHORS, ChangeLog, INSTALL, Makefile.am, NEWS, README, README.lib, TODO, ecm-ecm.h, ecm-impl.h, ecm.xml, eval.c, mpmod.c, mul_lo.c, polyeval.c, tune2.c:
	changes after remarks from Torbjo"rn on rc4

	* INSTALL, Makefile.am, auxi.c, candi.c, eval.c, main.c, memory.c:
	don't install tune*, ecmfactor
	fixed problems with -DMEMORY_DEBUG

2005-02-22  paul  <zimmerma>

	* INSTALL, Makefile.am, auxi.c, candi.c, eval.c, main.c, memory.c:
	don't install tune*, ecmfactor
	fixed problems with -DMEMORY_DEBUG

2005-02-22  alex  <kruppa>

	* stage2.c:
	bestD() overwriting original B2 caused B2 to keep ever growing. Fixed

	* README, bestd.c:
	Corrected computation of effective B2 value in bestD(). It did not account
	for rounding up due to integer block size. This changes computed
	probabilities, table in README updated accordingly

	* main.c: Added option -timestamp

	* INSTALL:
	On SunOS, the compiler and flags must be specified at configure time, or

	outputf() was missing the va_end(). Not sure if it is really needed (i.e. to
	avoid memleaks), but it's cleaner to have it

2005-02-22  paul  <zimmerma>

	* TODO, auxlib.c: fixed problem under MinGW (thanks Japke Rosink)

2005-02-22  alex  <kruppa>

	intermediate residues (after stage 1 etc), mere "-v" does not anymore

2005-02-18  paul  <zimmerma>

	* pp1.c:
	fixed problem with |S|=1 (was: pp1_mul did modify the exponent passed)

2005-02-18  alex  <kruppa>

	* pp1.c: A bug for |S| > 1 fixed, |S| == 1 still mysteriously broken

	* stage2.c, bestd.c, ecm-impl.h, ecm.h, ecm2.c, main.c, pm1.c, pp1.c:
	Using mpz_t for i0, s and related vars. Eliminates most overflow conditions.

	* stage2.c:
	Fixed segfault: n could get mpz_clear'd without having been inited
	Fixed overflow condition in fin_diff_coeff() by using mpz_t's. Makes
	test.pp1 work with |S| > 1.
	Small comment changes.

	Changed printf to outputf, #ifdef DEBUG to WANT_ASSERT and exit() to return
	with error status

2005-02-17  paul  <zimmerma>

	that the whole file is read into memory at one time, thus increasing memory footprint (but for good reasons).
	Added [-inp file] as an optional paramter (even though it is really an option), and list that the
	redirection of a file i.e. < file is now optional [ < file]. It is optional because of -inp file.
	Added -t n to "Options to control factorization method"
	Added -B2scale f to Options to control step 2
	Added -cofdec and -ve n to Options to control output
	Added info about incremental saving during B1 stage, and also documented that it is currently NOT working
	Added options "-i n", "-I f", "-n", "-nn", "-one" and "-b -d" to Miscellaneous options section.
	Added information that the first known problem has been eliminated (at least I know it is gone in my MinGW32 builds).
	Added 2 new "known problems" which are caused by the new stderr output for the 1 line output, and
	for the stage1/stage2 "percentage" done screen output (which btw, the stage2 percentage done is not
	yet done ;) The "second" of these new known problems is not a "certain" problem. It is one that
	someone (Paul) needs to look into and see how the interaction of this new stderr output works with
	the client server, and with things like nohup & under unix (I myself don't have access to any *nix shell)

	* main.c, pm1.c, pp1.c, ecm.h, ecm.c:
	Added a B2 scaling factor (user supplied multipler for calculated B2 values)

2003-03-25  jim  <jfoug>

	* ecm2.c:
	ecm.h was modified, but ecm2.c was missed and needed modified also.

	* resume.c:
	The incremental saving function has been neutered until it is working correctly in ecm/pm1/pp1 stage 1 functions.

	* main.c:
	Added -cofdef (forced cofactor in decimal even if an expression is "valid")
	Added a Cnnn "header" to the B1= .. line listing the length of the candidate (unless the candidate expression is explicitily listed)
	Fixed a couple of spots where the stderr 1 line output (in > redirection mode) was not erasing the prior line

	* auxi.c: Added high resulution timers to MinGW and MSVC builds.

2003-03-14  jim  <jfoug>

	* main.c:
	B2min was broken due to handling of the -i n and -I f auto incrementation code.

	-i file changed to -inp file.   -ib file removed.
	-i defaults to width-first and cat file | ecm b1 defaults to depth-first searching.
	added a -d for depth-first processing (to complement the -b breadth-first mode).
	Removed -a n  (constant B1 increment mode)
	Added -i n    (constant B1 increment mode)
	Added -I f    (Auto calculation (with scaling by f) B1 increment mode)
	Removed stage 1 precentage "setup" output.  That is now output in the 3 stage1 functions.

	* README:
	Added new options to document, but there is very little docmentation about them yet.  THIS IS STILL todo

	* TODO:
	Added -qq for ultra quiet mode (i.e. for running under the client/server)

	* eval.c:
	Fixed bugs introduced removing C++'ism.  The max val needed to be adjusted before the
	realloc, or we would simply realloc the same sized buffer (and then overwrite it)

	* main.c: Placed the fprintf(T:000) back where it needed to be.
	Remove any temp AutoSaved B1 file since it is no longer needed.

	* trial.c:
	The "testing code" for the T:000 to T:100 was not quite in the right place

2003-03-06  jim  <jfoug>

	* main.c:
	Added some code to do T:000 to T:100 (and 1: 2:) "percentage done" output to stderr (i.e. dummy lights)

	in Breadthfirst mode, now show "loop count" stderr line on first loop.
	in Breadthfirst mode, show the current line processing/total lines in file on the output line.

	* candi.c, eval.c, trial.c: files from Jim

2003-03-04  jim  <jfoug>

	* main.c: LOT of changes.

	New switches:
	  -a n      (auto increment B1 after each loop)
	  -i file   (input file, not from stdin)
	  -ib file  (breadth-first looping)
	  -b        (breadth-first looping for stdin)
	  -deep     (continued factoring after a factor is found)
	  -n        (nice mode, only fully implemented in Win32)
	  -nn       (VERY nice mode, i.e. idle)
	  -t n      (trial factoring, up to n)
	  -ve n     (verbose expression printing, for expressions < n chars)

	The read_number() now calls the expression parser.  read_number is only
	  used to skip blank (or commented) lines.  The expression parser does the rest.

	Most changes took place in the "looping" code, since now we loop either width
	  first (the current 5.0 default), or "breadth-first", and since during looping
	  the program may handle found factors either "shallow" (the current default
	  5.0 mode), or -deep.

	* auxi.c: nb_bits now const.
	A MUCH improved rand generator for Win32

	* TODO:
	Expression parse done.  -nice done (not -kill).  a "key" added so that todo's and done's can be listed

	* ecm-gmp.h:
	alloc.h did not work with MinGW. The change was taken from a GMP header

	* ecm.h:
	Created mpcandi_t struction (for warehousing info about the candidate)
	Use the mpcandi_t object instead of simple mpz_t where it is needed
	Added functions from candi.c, eval.c, trial.c (and main.c since read_number is needed by resume code)
	Made nb_bits be const

	* resume.c: Use mpcand_t for candidate numbers
	Output expressions in save/resume file (if expression exists)
	Patches for MinGW and MSVC for machine name

	* Makefile: Added candi.c eval.c and trial.c to Makefile
